Create a GA-4, Universal property. Universal property is mandate for Views
SiteKit is a plugin of google for support of GA4 integration to WordPress websites


SETUP-
Go to tracking code, add the script to index.html inside head tag
Test for the working of integration that user is online or not

HOW IT WORKS-
GA uses browser cookie to generate a random id to distinguish between new and returning visitors and tie all the activity of a visitor into a single visit
Each period of activity is called session, and is ended by 30 minutes of inactivity or when user closes browser window	


*Properties represent your website or app, max 50 properties, max 25 views
Recommended Views by GA - Raw, Test and Master. All Website Data is the default view created by GA
For getting age and gender, enable it in properties
*Filters are used to filter the data.
Filter requires upto 24 hrs to apply after adding
Filter order does matters
Filters are destructive, if a filter excludes data from a view then it cannot be recovered for that view
Filters cannot be applied retroactively
Common filters -    Exclude internal traffic(Self and local people exclude by IP address)
                    Filter domain referrals(Reduce spam traffic, excludes traffic from a referred domain)
                    Filter on Geography
                    Search and replace filters(replace urls/ids to understandable word)
*Goals measures how well your website fulfills your target objective
Funnel Visualization, Goal Flow Report is in Goals
Goals are limited to 20 per View
